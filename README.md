The author advocates that we disaggregate data by gender because women's needs are different than men's but we almost always default to what works best for men when it comes to medical research, city design, government structure, you name it. I read this one with my work book club. I usually don't pick up non-fiction, but this one was pretty good and worked well as an audio book since it read a little like a podcast."_ |
